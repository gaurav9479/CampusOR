I’m Gaurav Prajapati, B.TECH Materials Engineering MNNIT ALLAHABAD and I am excited to be a Contributor for the CampusOR project.

I’m joining this project to dive deep into real-time systems and scalable architecture. My focus is on contributing high-quality code and learning how to build robust features that solve real-world problems through open-source collaboration.
